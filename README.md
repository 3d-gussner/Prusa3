# PRUSA 3 - Models for my 3D printer

I'm afraid this is yet another distribution of the Prusa i3, that someone has found and modified to fit their needs. In this case that someone is me. Yes, that's right. You have stumbled upon the models for my version of the Prusa i3.

This collection of models is not an attempt to make the ultimate printer once and for all, but simply to make the work I have put a lot of efford into public domain. That is all. For use if you like.
